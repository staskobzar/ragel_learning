                  Uniform Resource Locators (URL)

             Access Information of Objects on the Network


                         ABOUT THIS DOCUMENT
                                   
   This document specifies a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), the
   syntax and semantics of formalized information for location and
   access of resources on the Internet.
   
   This document was written by the URI working group of the Internet
   Engineering Task Force.  Comments may be addressed to the editor,
   Tim Berners-Lee &lt;timbl@info.cern.ch>, or to the URI-WG
   &lt;uri@bunyip.com>. Discussions of the group are archived at 
   
  <http://www.acl.lanl.gov/URI/archive/uri-archive.index.html>

   This document is bound by the Requirements Specification in
   preparation.
   
   The work is derived from concepts introduced by the World-Wide Web
   global information initiative,  whose use of  such objects dates
   from 1990 and is described in "Universal Resource identifeirs for
   the World-Wide Web", RFCXXX .
